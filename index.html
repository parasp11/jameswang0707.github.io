	<h1>What is LitMojis™?</h1>
  <p>Tired of seeing normies sending emojis like these?</p><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/60/6d/48/606d48594ff56a8a055e4c9fb7d9a2ff.png"><p>Well, fear no more! We are proud to present the first app to offer 4K, 1080p, 60fps emojis for you to send to your friends. We also provide FRESH services such as 3D printed emojis, EmojiMaker, EmojiTranslator, and emoji theme packs. As well as these LIT services, we also will be sending 66% of our revenue to education funds in developing countries. We do this to provide to children the top tier of emoji-themed education, lifestyle, and society. We proudly introduce to you, LitMojis™.

	<p>The team at LitMojis Inc. are from Ontario, Canada. We wanted to provide to the education funds because any kid has the potential to become the next Bill Gates, but some kids don't have the money to have a proper emoji-themed education.
